[Verse 1]
You and I had seen
We're moving with the dream
Catching stars above
Tempting foolish love
But stars give way to day
And dreams, they fade to gray
And then a great storm came
And it began to rain

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing that's harder than telling you goodbye
Is knowing I'm not there to hold your head up when you cry

[Chorus]
So I'll keep watching the rain fall
And I have peace in knowing not, waiting for your call
And though I had to kiss you goodbye and farewell
How much I'll miss you, only time will tell

[Verse 2]
We caught each other's glance
The meeting was by chance
And suddenly a name
Will never be the same
I long to touch your face
And miss your sweet embrace
The memories I keep
They govern as I sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I wanted when I met you was your hand
Now all that I know you it's your grip that I can't stand

[Chorus]
So I'll keep watching the rain fall
And I have peace in knowing, not waiting for your call
And though I had to kiss you goodbye and farewell
How much you'll miss me, only time will tell

[Verse 3]
Now the storm has passed
I knew we wouldn't last
And in the ash we see
The people we must be
I still think of you
Do you still think of me?
A beg the powers that be
To finally set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
So write me a letter and tell me how you've been
Date it and sign it with love from you, my friend

[Chorus]
And I'll go on watching the rain fall
And I have peace in knowing, not waiting for your call
And though I had to kiss you goodbye and so long
Part of you is with me, and part of me is gone


[Outro]
Part of you is with me
And part of me is gone
