May I have your at-ten-tion, please?
May I have your at-ten-tion, please?
Will the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up?
I re-peat, will the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up?
We're gon-na have a prob-lem here...

Y'all act like you ne-ver seen a white per-son be-fore
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tom-my just burst in the door
And star-ted whoo-pin' her ass worse than be-fore
They first were di-vorced, thro-win' her o-ver fur-ni-ture (Agh!)
It's the re-turn of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kid-ding
He di-dn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… no-thing, you i-di-ots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my base-ment (ha ha!)
Fe-mi-nist wo-men love E-mi-nem
"Chic-ka, chic-ka, chic-ka, Slim Sha-dy, I'm sick of him
Look at him, wal-kin' a-round, grab-bin' his you-know-what
Flip-pin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I pro-ba-bly got a cou-ple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's go-in' on in your pa-rents' bed-rooms
Some-times I wan-na get on T-V and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm luc-ky, you might just give it a lit-tle kiss
And that's the mes-sage that we de-li-ver to lit-tle kids
And ex-pect them not to know what a wo-man's cli-to-ris is
Of course, they're gon-na know what in-ter-course is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Dis-co-ver-y Chan-nel, don't they?
We ain't not-hin' but mam-mals—well, some of us, can-ni-bals
Who cut ot-her peo-ple o-pen like can-ta-loupes
But if we can hump dead an-i-mals and an-te-lopes
Then there's no rea-son that a man and a-no-ther man can't e-lope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the an-ti-dote
Wo-men, wave your pan-ty-hose, sing the cho-rus, and it goes—

I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't got-ta cuss in his raps to sell rec-ords (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn ab-out a Gram-my?
Half of you crit-ics can't e-ven stom-ach me, let al-one stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, woul-dn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Brit-ney Spears?
Shit, Chris-ti-na A-gui-le-ra bet-ter switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Car-son Da-ly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em ar-gue over who she gave head to first
Lit-tle bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's mar-ried to Kim, hee-hee."
I should down-load her au-di-o in M-P-3
And show the whole world how you gave Em-i-nem V-D (Agh!)
I'm sick of you lit-tle girl and boy groups
All you do is an-noy me, so I have been sent here to de-stroy you
And there's a mil-lion of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to lis-ten to, ‘cause I'm only giv-in' you
Things you joke ab-out with your friends in-side your liv-in' room
The on-ly dif-fer-ence is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't got-ta be false or su-gar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whe-ther you like to ad-mit it, I just shit it
Bet-ter than 90% of you rap-pers out can
Then you won-der: "How can
Kids eat up these al-bums like Va-li-ums?"
It's fun-ny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm go-ing, when I'm 30
I'll be the on-ly per-son in the nur-sing home flir-ting
Pin-ching nurse's as-ses when I'm jac-king off with Jer-gens
And I'm jer-king, but this whole bag of Vi-a-gra is-n't wor-king
And ev-ery sin-gle per-son is a Slim Sha-dy lur-king
He could be wor-king at Bur-ger King, spit-tin' on your on-ion rings
Or in the par-king lot, cir-cling, scream-ing, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his win-dows down and his sys-tem up
So will the real Sha-dy please stand up
And put one of those fin-gers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out-ta your mind and out-ta con-trol
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Sha-dy, yes I'm the real Sha-dy
All you o-ther Slim Sha-dys are just im-i-ta-ting
So won't the real Slim Sha-dy please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Sha-dy in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up!
