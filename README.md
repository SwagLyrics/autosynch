# autosynch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SwagLyrics/autosynch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SwagLyrics/autosynch) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/SwagLyrics/autosynch/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/SwagLyrics/autosynch)

## about
Given an audio file of some recognizable song, autosynch will try to align its
lyrics to their temporal location in the song. The song lyrics must be available
on [Genius](https://genius.com).

## installation
To install, do the following:
- `git clone`
- `cd autosynch`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

*Note: autosynch is supported only on Python 3.6+.*

## dependencies
Using autosynch requires a trained model for vocal isolation as well as
PortAudio. For mp3 support, SoX is required. On MacOS/Linux, get everything by
executing:
```
chmod a+x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### download model
If you would like to download the weights manually or get a different version,
check here:
- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3334973.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3334973) for weights trained on MedleyDB V1
- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3351632.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3351632) for weights trained on MedleyDB V2

Weights must be placed into `autosynch/mad_twinnet/outputs/states`.

### install portaudio
On Mac:
```
brew install portaudio
```

On Linux:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
```

### install sox
*Note: Installing SoX is optional and only required for processing mp3 files.*

On Mac:
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

On Linux:
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## usage
To play a song with its lyrics displayed at its calculated position:
```
python autosynch/playback.py [audio_file.wav] [artist] [song_title]
```
It will take a few minutes to perform the alignment process. To save the
alignment data to eliminate processing time in future plays of the same audio,
add the flag `-s SAVE_DIR`, where `SAVE_DIR` is the directory you want to save
the alignment data

If you have already generated and saved an alignment data file:
```
python autosynch/playback.py [audio_file.wav] -f [align_file.yml]
```

If you would like to process an mp3 file, see [this section](#install-sox).
Running with an mp3 will automatically generate a wav file in the same directory.

*Note: If you did not use `setup.sh`, first make sure you set your Python
environment correctly with `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./` from the outer
`autosynch` directory.*

## demos
**Bruno Mars - Finesse**
[![Finesse demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/csBDM14ssts/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBDM14ssts)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBDM14ssts)
The last chorus lags behind a bit, but for the most part sections and lines are
nicely aligned.

**Fun. - We Are Young**
[![We Are Young demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z-yTGKd3ji8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-yTGKd3ji8)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-yTGKd3ji8)
The instrumental at the beginning throws off the first verse, but everything
catches up in by line 4.
