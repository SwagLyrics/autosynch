    viterbiTracking returns the best path through matrix logDensity,

    sequence, conditionally upon the hidden states. A hidden Markov
    model (HMM) is assumed, with prior probabilities for the states
    given by logPriorDensities, and transition probabilities given
    by the matrix logTransitionMatrix. More precisely:
    Inputs:
        logDensity is a S x N ndarray, where S is the number of hidden
                      states and N is the number of frames of the
                      observed signal. The element at row s and
                      column n contains the conditional likelihood
                      of the signal at frame n, conditionally upon
                      state s.
        logPrioroDensities is a ndarray of size S, containing the prior
                           probabilities of the hidden states of the HMM.
        logTransitionMatrix is a S x S ndarray containing the transition
                            probabilities: at row s and column t, it
                            contains the probability of having state t
                            after state s.
        verbose defines whether to display evolution information or not.
                Default is False.

    Outputs:
        bestStatePath is the sequence of best states, assuming the HMM
                      with the given parameters.
