def musdb18(directory, check_hash=True, subset=None, folder=None, shuffle=False, seed=None):
    """
    Generator function for the MUSDB18 data set. This allows you to loop through the entire data set
    with only a few :class:`AudioSignal` objects stored in memory at a time. There are options for
    only looping through a subset of the data set and shuffling the data set (with a seed). See
    details about those options below.

    `nussl` calculates the hash of the MUSDB18 directory and compares it against a precomputed hash
    for MUSDB18 that ships with `nussl`. This hash is used to verify that `nussl` understands the
    directory structure when reading the files. Calculating the hash can be turned off if the
    user needs a speed up, but this might cause oblique errors if the MUSDB directory is not set up
    in the same way as a fresh download of MUSDB18.

    The audio in MUSDB18 is stored in the 'stempeg' format from Native Instruments. `nussl` uses
    the `stempeg` library to read these files from disc, and returns each of the sources as
    individual :obj:`AudioSignal` objects.

    Examples:
        Using this generator function to loop through the MUSDB18 data set. In this example, we use
        the generator directly in the ``for`` loop.

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            musdb_path = '/path/to/MUSDB18'  # the MUSDB18 directory in disc
            for mix, drums, bass, other, vox in nussl.datasets.musdb(musdb_path):

                # Get some basic metadata on the files.
                # (They'll all have the same file name, but different labels)
                print(f'Mixture       - Filename: {mix.file_name}, Label: {mix.label}'
                print(f'Vocals        - Filename: {vox.file_name}, Label: {vox.label}'
                print(f'Accompaniment - Filename: {acc.file_name}, Label: {acc.label}'

                # Run an algorithm on the MUSDB18 files and save to disc
                r = nussl.Repet(mix)
                r.run()
                bg_est, fg_est = r.make_audio_signals()
                bg_est.write_audio_to_file(f'{os.path.splitext(mix.file_name)[0]}_bg.wav')
                fg_est.write_audio_to_file(f'{os.path.splitext(mix.file_name)[0]}_fg.wav')

        It's also possible to use ``tqdm`` to print the progress to the console. This is useful
        because running through an entire data set can take a while. Here's a more advanced example
        using some other options as well:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            import nussl
            import tdqm

            musdb_path = 'path/to/MUSDB18' # the MUSDB18 directory on disc

            # Only run on the 'test' folder (this has 50 songs)
            musdb_gen = nussl.datasets.musdb(musdb_path, subset='test', check_hash=False)

            # Tell tqdm the number of files we're running on so it can estimate a completion time
            for mix, drums, bass, other, vox in tqdm(musdb_gen, total=50):

                # Run an algorithm on the MUSDB18 files and save to disc
                r = nussl.Repet(mix)
                r.run()
                bg_est, fg_est = r.make_audio_signals()
                bg_est.write_audio_to_file(f'{os.path.splitext(mix.file_name)[0]}_bg.wav')
                fg_est.write_audio_to_file(f'{os.path.splitext(mix.file_name)[0]}_fg.wav')

    Args:
        directory (str): Top-level directory for the MUSDB18 data set.
        check_hash (bool, str): In the case that there is a mismatch between the expected and
            calculated hash, if this parameter is ``True`` (a bool) an exception is raised and
            if this parameter is ``'warn'`` (a string) a warning is printed to the console. If
            this parameter is ``False``, the hash will not be calculated for this directory, i.e.,
            this function does nothing.
        subset (float, list, str, None): This parameter determines how to make a subset of the
        audio files in the data set. There are four ways to use it, depending on what type
        this parameter takes:
        * If :param:`subset` is a ``float``, then :param:`subset` will return the first
        ``X.Y%`` of audio files, where ``X.Y%`` is some arbitrary percentage. In this case,
        :param:`subset` is expected to be in the range [0.0, 1.0].
        ( If :param:`subset` is a ``list``, it is expected to be a list of indices (as
        ``int``s). This function will then produce the audio files in the list that correspond
        to those indices.
        ( If :param:`subset` is a ``str``, it will only include audio files with that string
        somewhere in the directory name.
        * If :param:`subset` is ``None``, then the whole data set is traversed unobstructed.
        shuffle (bool): Whether the data set should be shuffled.
        seed (int, 1-d array_like): Seed for ``numpy``'s random number generator used for
        shuffling.

    Yields:
        (tuple):
            A tuple of five :class:`AudioSignal` objects, with audio loaded for each source. In
            the tuple, they are returned in the following order:
            ``(mixture, drums, bass, other, vox)``.
